\section{Introduction}
The aim of this project is to design and implement two deep learning models for text/sentiment classification, capable of identifying the emotion conveyed in a given text. The model is trained on the \textit{dair-ai/emotion} dataset, a widely used collection of 20,000 labeled tweets available through Hugging Face. This dataset is divided into six emotion categories: sadness (0), joy (1), love (2), anger (3), fear (4), and surprise (5). Of the total dataset, 2,000 tweets are reserved exclusively for final testing.
