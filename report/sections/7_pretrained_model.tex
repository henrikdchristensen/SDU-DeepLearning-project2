\section{Pretrained Model (RoBERTa)}
% To see how good our model performs compared to a well-known model, we used the pretrained model 'AlexNet'.
% This model is pretrained on the ImageNet dataset, which contains 1.2 million images and 1000 classes, also including cats and dogs.
% However, to use the pretrained model for this binary classification task, the output layer is modified.
% The results of the pretrained model after 20 epochs are shown in Figure \ref{fig:results_alexnet}. The test accuracy is summarized in Table \ref{tab:alexnet}.

% As expected the pretrained model performs sligtly better than our model. However, AlexNet also is trained on a much larger dataset and has a lot more parameters ($\sim 57$ million) compared to our model ($\sim 21$ million). The feature maps look pretty similar to our model, but is less interpretable, probably generalizing better to other objects.
